  <code>ngAnimate</code>
</h1>

<p>The <code>ngAnimate</code> module provides support for CSS-based animations (keyframes and transitions) as well as JavaScript-based animations via
callback hooks. Animations are not enabled by default, however, by including <code>ngAnimate</code> then the animation hooks are enabled for an Angular app.</p>
<div doc-module-components="ngAnimate"></div>

<h1 id="usage">Usage</h1>
<p>Simply put, there are two ways to make use of animations when ngAnimate is used: by using <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. The former works purely based
using CSS (by using matching CSS selectors/styles) and the latter triggers animations that are registered via <code>module.animation()</code>. For
both CSS and JS animations the sole requirement is to have a matching <code>CSS class</code> that exists both in the registered animation and within
the HTML element that the animation will be triggered on.</p>

<h2 id="css-based-animations">CSS-based Animations</h2>
<p>CSS-based animations with ngAnimate are unique since they require no JavaScript code at all. By using a CSS class that we reference between our HTML
and CSS code we can create an animation that will be picked up by Angular when an the underlying directive performs an operation.</p>
<p>The example below shows how an <code>enter</code> animation can be made possible on a element using <code>ng-if</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;div ng-if=&quot;bool&quot; class=&quot;fade&quot;&gt;
   Fade me in out
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;button ng-click=&quot;bool=true&quot;&gt;Fade In!&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button ng-click=&quot;bool=false&quot;&gt;Fade Out!&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the CSS class <strong>fade</strong>? We can now create the CSS transition code that references this class:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css">/* The starting CSS styles for the enter animation */
.fade.ng-enter {
  transition:0.5s linear all;
  opacity:0;
}

/* The starting CSS styles for the enter animation */
.fade.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
  opacity:1;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The key thing to remember here is that, depending on the animation event (which each of the directives above trigger depending on what&#39;s going on) two
generated CSS classes will be applied to the element; in the example above we have <code>.ng-enter</code> and <code>.ng-enter-active</code>. For CSS transitions, the transition
code <strong>must</strong> be defined within the starting CSS class (in this case <code>.ng-enter</code>). The destination class is what the transition will animate towards.</p>
<p>If for example we wanted to create animations for <code>leave</code> and <code>move</code> (ngRepeat triggers move) then we can do so using the same CSS naming conventions:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css">/* now the element will fade out before it is removed from the DOM */
.fade.ng-leave {
  transition:0.5s linear all;
  opacity:1;
}
.fade.ng-leave.ng-leave-active {
  opacity:0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can also make use of <strong>CSS Keyframes</strong> by referencing the keyframe animation within the starting CSS class:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css">/* there is no need to define anything inside of the destination
CSS class since the keyframe will take charge of the animation */
.fade.ng-leave {
  animation: my_fade_animation 0.5s linear;
  -webkit-animation: my_fade_animation 0.5s linear;
}

@keyframes my_fade_animation {
  from { opacity:1; }
  to { opacity:0; }
}

@-webkit-keyframes my_fade_animation {
  from { opacity:1; }
  to { opacity:0; }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Feel free also mix transitions and keyframes together as well as any other CSS classes on the same element.</p>
<h3 id="css-class-based-animations">CSS Class-based Animations</h3>
<p>Class-based animations (animations that are triggered via <code>ngClass</code>, <code>ngShow</code>, <code>ngHide</code> and some other directives) have a slightly different
naming convention. Class-based animations are basic enough that a standard transition or keyframe can be referenced on the class being added
and removed.</p>
<p>For example if we wanted to do a CSS animation for <code>ngHide</code> then we place an animation on the <code>.ng-hide</code> CSS class:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;div ng-show=&quot;bool&quot; class=&quot;fade&quot;&gt;
  Show and hide me
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;button ng-click=&quot;bool=true&quot;&gt;Toggle&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
.fade.ng-hide {
  transition:0.5s linear all;
  opacity:0;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>All that is going on here with ngShow/ngHide behind the scenes is the <code>.ng-hide</code> class is added/removed (when the hidden state is valid). Since
ngShow and ngHide are animation aware then we can match up a transition and ngAnimate handles the rest.</p>
<p>In addition the addition and removal of the CSS class, ngAnimate also provides two helper methods that we can use to further decorate the animation
with CSS styles.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;div ng-class=&quot;{on:onOff}&quot; class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
  Highlight this box
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;button ng-click=&quot;onOff=!onOff&quot;&gt;Toggle&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
.highlight {
  transition:0.5s linear all;
}
.highlight.on-add {
  background:white;
}
.highlight.on {
  background:yellow;
}
.highlight.on-remove {
  background:black;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>We can also make use of CSS keyframes by placing them within the CSS classes.</p>
<h3 id="css-staggering-animations">CSS Staggering Animations</h3>
<p>A Staggering animation is a collection of animations that are issued with a slight delay in between each successive operation resulting in a
curtain-like effect. The ngAnimate module (versions &gt;=1.2) supports staggering animations and the stagger effect can be
performed by creating a <strong>ng-EVENT-stagger</strong> CSS class and attaching that class to the base CSS class used for
the animation. The style property expected within the stagger class can either be a <strong>transition-delay</strong> or an
<strong>animation-delay</strong> property (or both if your animation contains both transitions and keyframe animations).</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css">.my-animation.ng-enter {
  /* standard transition code */
  transition: 1s linear all;
  opacity:0;
}
.my-animation.ng-enter-stagger {
  /* this will have a 100ms delay between each successive leave animation */
  transition-delay: 0.1s;

  /* in case the stagger doesn&#39;t work then the duration value
   must be set to 0 to avoid an accidental CSS inheritance */
  transition-duration: 0s;
}
.my-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
  /* standard transition styles */
  opacity:1;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Staggering animations work by default in ngRepeat (so long as the CSS class is defined). Outside of ngRepeat, to use staggering animations
on your own, they can be triggered by firing multiple calls to the same event on $animate. However, the restrictions surrounding this
are that each of the elements must have the same CSS className value as well as the same parent element. A stagger operation
will also be reset if one or more animation frames have passed since the multiple calls to <code>$animate</code> were fired.</p>
<p>The following code will issue the <strong>ng-leave-stagger</strong> event on the element provided:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">var kids = parent.children();

$animate.leave(kids[0]); //stagger index=0
$animate.leave(kids[1]); //stagger index=1
$animate.leave(kids[2]); //stagger index=2
$animate.leave(kids[3]); //stagger index=3
$animate.leave(kids[4]); //stagger index=4

window.requestAnimationFrame(function() {
  //stagger has reset itself
  $animate.leave(kids[5]); //stagger index=0
  $animate.leave(kids[6]); //stagger index=1

  $scope.$digest();
});
</code></pre>
<p>Stagger animations are currently only supported within CSS-defined animations.</p>
<h2 id="javascript-based-animations">JavaScript-based Animations</h2>
<p>ngAnimate also allows for animations to be consumed by JavaScript code. The approach is similar to CSS-based animations (where there is a shared
CSS class that is referenced in our HTML code) but in addition we need to register the JavaScript animation on the module. By making use of the
<code>module.animation()</code> module function we can register the ainmation.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see an example of a enter/leave animation using <code>ngRepeat</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;div ng-repeat=&quot;item in items&quot; class=&quot;slide&quot;&gt;
  {{ item }}
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>See the <strong>slide</strong> CSS class? Let&#39;s use that class to define an animation that we&#39;ll structure in our module code by using <code>module.animation</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">myModule.animation(&#39;.slide&#39;, [function() {
  return {
    // make note that other events (like addClass/removeClass)
    // have different function input parameters
    enter: function(element, doneFn) {
      jQuery(element).fadeIn(1000, doneFn);

      // remember to call doneFn so that angular
      // knows that the animation has concluded
    },

    move: function(element, doneFn) {
      jQuery(element).fadeIn(1000, doneFn);
    },

    leave: function(element, doneFn) {
      jQuery(element).fadeOut(1000, doneFn);
    }
  }
}]
</code></pre>
<p>The nice thing about JS-based animations is that we can inject other services and make use of advanced animation libraries such as
greensock.js and velocity.js.</p>
<p>If our animation code class-based (meaning that something like <code>ngClass</code>, <code>ngHide</code> and <code>ngShow</code> triggers it) then we can still define
our animations inside of the same registered animation, however, the function input arguments are a bit different:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;div ng-class=&quot;color&quot; class=&quot;colorful&quot;&gt;
  this box is moody
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;button ng-click=&quot;color=&#39;red&#39;&quot;&gt;Change to red&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button ng-click=&quot;color=&#39;blue&#39;&quot;&gt;Change to blue&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button ng-click=&quot;color=&#39;green&#39;&quot;&gt;Change to green&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-js">myModule.animation(&#39;.colorful&#39;, [function() {
  return {
    addClass: function(element, className, doneFn) {
      // do some cool animation and call the doneFn
    },
    removeClass: function(element, className, doneFn) {
      // do some cool animation and call the doneFn
    },
    setClass: function(element, addedClass, removedClass, doneFn) {
      // do some cool animation and call the doneFn
    }
  }
}]
</code></pre>
<h2 id="css-js-animations-together">CSS + JS Animations Together</h2>
<p>AngularJS 1.4 and higher has taken steps to make the amalgamation of CSS and JS animations more flexible. However, unlike earlier versions of Angular,
defining CSS and JS animations to work off of the same CSS class will not work anymore. Therefore example below will only result in <strong>JS animations taking
charge of the animation</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;div ng-if=&quot;bool&quot; class=&quot;slide&quot;&gt;
  Slide in and out
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-js">myModule.animation(&#39;.slide&#39;, [function() {
  return {
    enter: function(element, doneFn) {
      jQuery(element).slideIn(1000, doneFn);
    }
  }
}]
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-css">.slide.ng-enter {
  transition:0.5s linear all;
  transform:translateY(-100px);
}
.slide.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
  transform:translateY(0);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Does this mean that CSS and JS animations cannot be used together? Do JS-based animations always have higher priority? We can suppliment for the
lack of CSS animations by making use of the <code>$animateCss</code> service to trigger our own tweaked-out, CSS-based animations directly from
our own JS-based animation code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">myModule.animation(&#39;.slide&#39;, [&#39;$animateCss&#39;, function($animateCss) {
  return {
    enter: function(element, doneFn) {
      var animation = $animateCss(element, {
        event: &#39;enter&#39;
      });

      if (animation) {
        // this will trigger `.slide.ng-enter` and `.slide.ng-enter-active`.
        var runner = animation.start();
        runner.done(doneFn);
      } else { //no CSS animation was detected
        doneFn();
      }
    }
  }
}]
</code></pre>
<p>The nice thing here is that we can save bandwidth by sticking to our CSS-based animation code and we don&#39;t need to rely on a 3rd-party animation framework.</p>
<p>The <code>$animateCss</code> service is very powerful since we can feed in all kinds of extra properties that will be evaluated and fed into a CSS transition or
keyframe animation. For example if we wanted to animate the height of an element while adding and removing classes then we can do so by providing that
data into <code>$animateCss</code> directly:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">myModule.animation(&#39;.slide&#39;, [&#39;$animateCss&#39;, function($animateCss) {
  return {
    enter: function(element, doneFn) {
      var animation = $animateCss(element, {
        event: &#39;enter&#39;,
        addClass: &#39;maroon-setting&#39;,
        from: { height:0 },
        to: { height: 200 }
      });

      if (animation) {
        animation.start().done(doneFn);
      } else {
        doneFn();
      }
    }
  }
}]
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can fill in the rest via our transition CSS code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css">/* the transition tells ngAnimate to make the animation happen */
.slide.ng-enter { transition:0.5s linear all; }

/* this extra CSS class will be absorbed into the transition
since the $animateCss code is adding the class */
.maroon-setting { background:red; }
</code></pre>
<p>And <code>$animateCss</code> will figure out the rest. Just make sure to have the <code>done()</code> callback fire the <code>doneFn</code> function to signal when the animation is over.</p>

<h2 id="using-animate-in-your-directive-code">Using $animate in your directive code</h2>
<p>So far we&#39;ve explored how to feed in animations into an Angular application, but how do we trigger animations within our own directives in our application?
By injecting the <code>$animate</code> service into our directive code, we can trigger structural and class-based hooks which can then be consumed by animations. Let&#39;s
imagine we have a greeting box that shows and hides itself when the data changes</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;greeing-box active=&quot;onOrOff&quot;&gt;Hi there&lt;/greeting-box&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-js">ngModule.directive(&#39;greetingBox&#39;, [&#39;$animate&#39;, function($animate) {
  return function(scope, element, attrs) {
    attrs.$observe(&#39;active&#39;, function(value) {
      value ? $animate.addClass(element, &#39;on&#39;) ? $animate.removeClass(element, &#39;on&#39;);
    });
  });
}]);
</code></pre>
<p>Now the <code>on</code> CSS class is added and removed on the greeting box component. Now if we add a CSS class on top of the greeting box element
in our HTML code then we can trigger a CSS or JS animation to happen.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css">/* normally we would create a CSS class to reference on the element */
[greeting-box].on { transition:0.5s linear all; background:green; color:white; }
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>$animate</code> service contains a variety of other methods like <code>enter</code>, <code>leave</code>, <code>animate</code> and <code>setClass</code>. To learn more about what&#39;s
possible be sure to visit the <a href="api/ng/service/$animate">$animate service API page</a>.</p>
<h3 id="preventing-collisions-with-third-party-libraries">Preventing Collisions With Third Party Libraries</h3>
<p>Some third-party frameworks place animation duration defaults across many element or className
selectors in order to make their code small and reuseable. This can lead to issues with ngAnimate, which
is expecting actual animations on these elements and has to wait for their completion.</p>
<p>You can prevent this unwanted behavior by using a prefix on all your animation classes:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css">/* prefixed with animate- */
.animate-fade-add.animate-fade-add-active {
  transition:1s linear all;
  opacity:0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>You then configure <code>$animate</code> to enforce this prefix:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">$animateProvider.classNameFilter(/animate-/);
</code></pre>
<p>This also may provide your application with a speed boost since only specific elements containing CSS class prefix
will be evaluated for animation when any DOM changes occur in the application.</p>
<h2 id="callbacks-and-promises">Callbacks and Promises</h2>
<p>When <code>$animate</code> is called it returns a promise that can be used to capture when the animation has ended. Therefore if we were to trigger
an animation (within our directive code) then we can continue performing directive and scope related activities after the animation has
ended by chaining onto the returned promise that animation method returns.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">// somewhere within the depths of the directive
$animate.enter(element, parent).then(function() {
  //the animation has completed
});
</code></pre>
<p>(Note that earlier versions of Angular prior to v1.4 required the promise code to be wrapped using <code>$scope.$apply(...)</code>. This is not the case
anymore.)</p>
<p>In addition to the animation promise, we can also make use of animation-related callbacks within our directives and controller code by registering
an event listener using the <code>$animate</code> service. Let&#39;s say for example that an animation was triggered on our <code>ng-view</code> element and we wanted our
routing controller to hook into that:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">ngModule.controller(&#39;HomePageController&#39;, [&#39;$animate&#39;, function($animate) {
  $animate.on(&#39;enter&#39;, &#39;[ng-view]&#39;, function(element) {
    // the animation for this route has completed
  }]);
}])
</code></pre>
<p>(Note that you will need to trigger a digest within the callback to get angular to notice any scope-related changes.)</p>



  <h2>Installation</h2>

  <p>First include <code>angular-animate.js</code> in your HTML:</p>

  <pre><code>&lt;script src=&quot;angular.js&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;script src=&quot;angular-animate.js&quot;&gt;</code></pre>

  <p>You can download this file from the following places:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide#angularjs">Google CDN</a><br>
      e.g. <code>//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/X.Y.Z/angular-animate.js</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://bower.io">Bower</a><br>
      e.g. <pre><code>bower install angular-animate@X.Y.Z</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://code.angularjs.org/">code.angularjs.org</a><br>
      e.g. <pre><code>&quot;//code.angularjs.org/X.Y.Z/angular-animate.js&quot;</code></pre>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>where X.Y.Z is the AngularJS version you are running.</p>
  <p>Then load the module in your application by adding it as a dependent module:</p>
  <pre><code>angular.module(&#39;app&#39;, [&#39;ngAnimate&#39;]);</code></pre>

  <p>With that you&apos;re ready to get started!</p>
